# NIST-CSF-Metrics
This repository hosts the topics from a 2015 RSA talk on metrics.  Including a spreadsheet that suggests potential metrics.

The .key presentation and the .pdf of the presentation should be the "final" slides used.

The .zip file contains source files for mind maps used to perform the GQM process.   Those .nm5 files are Novamind 5 files (the application used to create the mind maps).
